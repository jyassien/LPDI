### Project title: Live Plant Disease Identification (LPDI)     
### Project description:     
This project aims to build a web app for real-time identification of plant diseases through live
camera input. By analyzing an image of a plant, the app will detect visual indicators of disease,
such as color changes, brown spots, and distorted patterns caused by conditions like blight,
mildew, or rust. The user will receive instant feedback with highlighted areas on the image
showing identified disease spots, along with the name of the detected disease, or a message
indicating "No disease detected" if no issues are found as well as a confidence level.
